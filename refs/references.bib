  abstract = {Plants display remarkable abilities to adjust growth and development to environmental conditions, such as the amount of available water. This developmental plasticity is apparent not only in root and shoot growth rates, but also in tissue patterning and cell morphology.1,2 We have previously shown that in response to limited water availability, Arabidopsis thaliana root displays changes in xylem morphology, mediated by the non-cell-autonomous action of abscisic acid, ABA.2 Here, we show, through analyses of ABA response reporters and tissue-specific suppression of ABA signaling, that xylem cells themselves act as primary signaling centers governing both xylem cell fate and xylem differentiation rate, revealing the cell-autonomous control of multiple aspects of xylem development by ABA. ABA rapidly activates the expression of genes encoding VASCULAR-RELATED NAC DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that the two ABA-mediated xylem developmental changes are regulated by distinct members of this transcription factor family, with VND2 and VND3 promoting differentiation rate of metaxylem cells, while VND7 promotes the conversion of metaxylem toward protoxylem morphology. This phenomenon shows how different aspects of developmental plasticity can be interlinked, yet genetically separable. Moreover, similarities in phenotypic and molecular responses to ABA in diverse species indicate evolutionary conservation of the ABA-xylem development regulatory network among eudicots. Hence, this study gives molecular insights into how environmental stress modifies plant vascular anatomy and has potential relevance for water use optimization and adaptation to drought conditions.},

  abstract = {A reduced rate of stem cell division is considered a widespread feature which ensures the integrity of genetic information during somatic development of plants and animals. Radial growth of plant shoots and roots is a stem cell-driven process that is fundamental for the mechanical and physiological support of enlarging plant bodies. In most dicotyledonous species, the underlying stem cell niche, the cambium, generates xylem inwards and phloem outwards. Despite the importance and intriguing dynamics of the cambium, the functional characterization of its stem cells is hampered by the lack of experimental tools for accessing distinct cambium sub-domains. Here, we use the hypocotyl of Arabidopsis thaliana to map stem cell activity in the proliferating cambium. Through pulse labeling and genetically encoded lineage tracing, we find that a single bifacial stem cell generates both xylem and phloem cell lineages. This cell is characterized by a specific combination of PXY (TDR), SMXL5 and WOX4 gene activity and a high division rate in comparison with tissue-specific progenitors. Our analysis provides a cellular fate map of radial plant growth, and suggests that stem cell quiescence is not a general prerequisite for life-long tissue production.},
